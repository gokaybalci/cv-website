        Hi, my name is Gökay and I'm an educator. It's always gratifying to help and teach people as well as partaking in a rabbit hole with students because everyone asks different questions that would never occur to me.

        I am now looking for my next adventure, so feel free to browse the <a class="about_me_links" href="/projects">projects</a> section to check out what I've built, <a class="about_me_links" href="/contact">shoot me an email</a> or connect on <a class="about_me_links" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gokay-balci/">linkedIn</a>.
